          Because the water heater tank is leaking, the water heater will have
          to be replaced. Because of the age of your water heater, it is no
          longer covered by warranty.

          Generally, a new water heater will come with a six year (or longer)
          parts and tank warranty and in-home service coverage. A new water
          heater will be more efficient than your old one and will cost less to
          operate. A new water heater will also give you one more thing: peace
          of mind.
